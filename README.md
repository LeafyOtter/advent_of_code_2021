# Advent of Code 2021
## Theme : Dice maniac

For this advent of code, i've prepared myself a table of language.
Each day i will roll a d20 and use the language associated with it.

### Dice table

| Results | Language     |
|:-------:|:------------:|
|    1    | Java         |
|   2-3   | Asm          |
|   4-5   | Shell script |
|   6-7   | Javascript   |
|   8-9   | Haskell      |
|  10-11  | Python       |
|  12-13  | Go           |
|  14-15  | C++          |
|  16-17  | Rust         |
|  18-19  | C (norm)     |
|    20   | C            |

> ASM?

Assembly language. I will use the x86 set of instructions, so it can work on my computer.

> What is C (norm) ?

It's basic C, except i have to follow the writing norm used in my school.
Which restrict the utilisation of some control structure, like for, switch, or case. It also restricts the utilisation of external functions. (This one depend of the project though.)  
So basicly no fgets(), printf() or basic function. I will only be able to use syscall, or wrappers of syscall.
A few of the functions i will allow myself are write(), read(), malloc(), free(), open(), close(), etc.
Of course I will modify this list depending of the question.

### Logs of the event

Day 1 : Rolled a 1. Language is Java. Was not that bad honestly.  
Day 2 : Rolled a 20. Language is C. That's pretty sweet.
